# Image-Recognition
Design and Development of an Image Recognition Algorithm that can Predict Images of a Fruit

<br/>In this notebook, we will showcase the main functions of our Image Recognition Algorithm. 
<br/>The algorithm leverages a convolutional neural network to first train a model to see how well it could fare on a dataset of fruits. 
<br/>Thereafter, data augmentation tools were utilized to see how well we could improve on a model that we trained ourselves. 
<br/>The model was used on a completely new dataset with fruits to see how well it could recognize it.

<br/>The main code is found in <b>Image_Recognition.ipynb file</b>.


<br/>We have uploaded our Intent Recogniser Neural Network Model into the repository:

Keras_model.keras


<br/>We have 3 pre-processed csv files, which include:

1. train_df.csv
2. test_df.csv
3. val_df.csv

<br/>This notebook was done together with my fellow group member Oh Sheng Han - for our Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence module of MA 4891 in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
