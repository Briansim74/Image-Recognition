# Image-Recognition
Design and Development of an Image Recognition Algorithm that can Predict Images of Fruits

<br/>In this notebook, we will showcase the main functions of our Image Recognition Algorithm. The algorithm leverages a convolutional neural network to first train a model to see how well it could fare on a dataset of fruits. Thereafter, data augmentation tools were utilized to see how well we could improve on a model that we trained ourselves. The model was used on a completely new dataset with fruits to see how well it could recognize it.

<br/>The main code is found in <b>Image_Recognition.ipynb file</b>.

<br/>We have used Fruit Images from the Kaggle Dataset, which includes:

1. fruits_train.zip
2. fruits_test.zip

<br/>We have uploaded our Image Recognition Models into the repository:

1. Sequential_Model_Pre_Data_Augmented.keras
2. Sequential_Model_After_Data_Augmented.keras
3. Pretrained_Mobile_Net_V2_model.keras

<br/>We have also uploaded our respective model histories, which include:

1. training_history_pre_data_augmented.json
2. training_history_after_data_augmented.json
3. pretrained_model_history.json
4. pretrained_model_history_fine.json

<br/>This notebook was done together with my fellow group member Oh Sheng Han - for our Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence module of MA 4891 in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
